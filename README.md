# 🚕 Uber Pickup Analysis — New York City 

## 🧩 Project Overview

This end-to-end project focuses on analyzing Uber pickup data from New York City (April–June 2014).
The objective was to uncover ride-demand trends across time and location to improve driver deployment and operational efficiency.

- Python was used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify daily, weekly, and monthly pickup patterns.
- Excel was utilized for data cleaning and date-time formatting.
- Power BI was used to design an interactive dashboard visualizing key insights such as base distribution, peak hours, and pickup zones.

This analysis helps understand passenger demand behavior, optimize driver allocation, and support data-driven decision-making

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze daily, weekly, and monthly ride-demand patterns to understand temporal trends.
- Identify the most active dispatching bases contributing to overall trip volume.
- Examine hourly pickup activity to determine peak demand hours.
- Visualize geographical distribution of pickups using latitude and longitude to locate high-demand zones.
- Provide actionable insights to help optimize driver allocation and enhance operational efficiency.
